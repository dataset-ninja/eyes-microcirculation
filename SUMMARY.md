**Eyes Microcirculation: Medicine Dataset for Eyes Semantic Segmentation Task** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 962 images with 4277 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*vessel*).

Images in the Eyes Microcirculation dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 313 (33% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (655 images) and *test* (307 images). The dataset was released in 2022.
